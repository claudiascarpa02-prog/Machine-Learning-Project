# Machine-Learning-Project
In this track, your task is to develop and train machine learning models to predict the tags of a story. Specifically, for each of the six tags, the models must predict whether the tag applies to the story, or not. Note that the models must solve six binary classification tasks (not one classification task with six classes).
I modelli salvati tramite la training procedure cnn e roberta, insieme al dataset iniziale, sono disponibili a [questo link:](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y8tpu24vhWwJXxj8jdYRPNnrsaI-aq_f?usp=drive_link)
